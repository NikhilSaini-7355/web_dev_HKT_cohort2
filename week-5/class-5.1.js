// three jargons in react:- state , components, re-rendering
// as per frontend devs any website can be divided into two parts:-
// States and Components
// State:- An object that represents the current state of the app
         // It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change)
         // For example, the value of the counter

// components:- How a DOM element should render, given a state
             // It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state
             // This button is a component
             // It takes the state (currentCount) as an input
             // And is supposed to render accordingly

// Re-rendering:- A state change triggers a re-render
                // A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated
                // when the state changes
